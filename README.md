# 📋 TODO List on Node.js and HTML

This is a small pet project that serves as a TODO List application. The backend is developed with Node.js using the Express.js library, while the frontend is built using HTML, JavaScript, and SASS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** (version 15)
- **SASS**

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL

- Download and install [PostgreSQL 15](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Create a new database:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE todo;
  ```
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running on port `5432` (default port).

### 3. Install Dependencies and Start the Server

Navigate to the `backend` directory, install the dependencies, and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node app.js
```

### 4. Configuration

You may need to configure the database connection in `backend/src/core/db/db.js`:

```javascript
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

const db = new Sequelize(
    'postgres',
    'username',
    'password',
    {
        host: 'host',
        port: 'port',
        dialect: 'postgres'
    }
)

module.exports = { db };
```
Replace `'username'`, `'password'`, `'host'` and `'port'` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### 5. Enjoy the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and start using the TODO List.
